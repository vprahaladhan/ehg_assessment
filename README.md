# Improvised colors display app

This is a slightly improvised colors display app. Instead of showing each pixel with a different color in a 256x128px (or multiples thereof) canvas, which makes it difficult to distinguish between colors, the app shows each color in a 40x40px block (changes according to screen width) so each color is distinguishable from the other (not to the naked eye). This way the height of the colors container exceeds the height of vwport and has to be scrolled to see other colors. The app initially shows 32x32 colors/blocks and upon scrolling down, loads the next set of 32x32 colors, so not all colors are loaded at once making load time faster. The block also lists the color combination of the block as RGB & HEX values when hovered over.
